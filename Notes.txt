Side notes:
Take out all buttons in logs (Should never be edited) (*ask bout di)
Can you repeat product names (For now we can) (Don't think we should cause we are using name for finding)
When adding products you cant input less than 1 after typing
*if theres time, use regex to confirm price and stock only has numbers when adding product
tried removing product after all stock is bought but history crashes when i did so lets just keep it and say that its an indication that its currently out of stock
